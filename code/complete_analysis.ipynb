    "Info about available datasets is in the wiki, see https://github.com/datamission/WFP/wiki/Datasets-wiki-page. The wiki contains much more info, see https://github.com/datamission/WFP/wiki.\n",

    "# Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gain insight into factors influencing Reduced Coping Strategy Index (rCSI) and Food Consumption Score (FCS). See https://github.com/datamission/WFP/wiki/List-of-Acronyms for definitions\n",
    "* Predict rCSI and FCS on more granular spatial level than currently available\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is distribution of food scores vs region, income, city/rural area, ..?\n",
    "* Should we work with aggregated food scores or more granular survey data?\n",
    "* Filter/select regions with enough data before training ML models?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Todo\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create Jupyter notebook (Python)\n",
    "* Preprocess\n",
    "  * Gather data\n",
    "  * Clean data\n",
    "  * Join data sets on region (where possible) \n",
    "* Exploratory Analysis\n",
    "  * Plot indicators on map\n",
    "  * Plot aggregated survey answers\n",
    "  * Histogram/plot of aggregated survey answers vs indicators\n",
    "* Perform Inference\n",
    "  * Check variance for indicators per region\n",
    "  * Check number of data points per region\n",
    "* Machine Learning\n",
    "  * Regression problem (mean food score per region, percent below certain threshold per region?)\n",
    "  * Convert to classification problem?\n",
    "  * Potentially useful algoritms: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Linear Regression, SVM\n",
